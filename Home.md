Pre-training has become an essential part for NLP tasks. UER-py (Universal Encoder Representations) is a toolkit for pre-training on general-domain corpus and fine-tuning on downstream task. UER-py maintains model modularity and supports research extensibility. It facilitates the use of existing pre-training models, and provides interfaces for users to further extend upon. With UER-py, we build a model zoo which contains pre-trained models based on different corpora, encoders, and targets.
